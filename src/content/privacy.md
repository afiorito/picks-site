This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on Electriapp's website and apps for iOS and any other devices or platforms. We will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

Any information collected is anonymized device data. Electriapp does not collect any personal information in Picks or on the website. Data on device type, operating system, in-app purchases and user experience is automatically collected when using our product. Electriapp does not have access to content you create in Picks.

If you purchase Picks Pro, additional non-personally identifiable data will be kept. Your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the App Store and are not visible to us. We will simply get information about whether or not you made a purchase. This is all made available to us in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with the purchase provider ([RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa)).

## Information Usage

Any information collected is anonymized device diagnostic data. We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support. All content created on the device is stored solely on the device. Optionally, you can enable backup to Apple's iCloud which is not managed by us. Electriapp has no access to data stored in iCloud.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email support@electriapp.com.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
