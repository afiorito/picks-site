This release contains a new feature for generators: **Looping**!

Looping allows a generator to automatically generate after a specified interval.

A new Screen Auto-Lock setting stops your device from automatically locking the screen while looping. Check it out on the settings page.

This release has some bug fixes and performance improvements as well:

- Resolved issues with switching between generators on iPad
- Sized modals properly for all screens
